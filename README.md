# Machine Learning Foundations: Ep #1- What is ML?
 

Hello! Welcome to the first **R** code walkthrough of the session ***Machine Learning Foundations*** where the awesome [Laurence Moroney](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurence-moroney),a Developer Advocate at Google working on Artificial Intelligence, takes you through the fundamentals of building machine learning models using TensorFlow.

In the first YouTube session, [Episode 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z9TRANg4c0&lc=UgyZovmGs5ZzU-9g2RN4AaABAg.98TaXjZj0VH98UAi73GE_g),Laurence Moroney talks about what machine learning actually is and how it works, including a simple hands-on example to get you started building ML models--the “Hello World” of machine learning!
